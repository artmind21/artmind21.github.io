# Art Mind in the 21st Century

Visual artist's quest to find an answer to the question: *What should be art in the 21st century?*

*The short answer:* human way of thinking changed tremendously, and art's mission is to reflect that, and evolve accordingly

### The Long Answer ###

In a sense, art has always been interactive - artists  strived to engage viewers with their pictures as much possible.  That's why *perspective* was invented, that's why realistic painting was prevalant for centuries
(Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Titian).

That's until the photography was invented, which freed artists from representational art. Began the era of the Modern Art - impressionism, expressionism, etc. - which focussed on the spiritual side of things. 

Alongside the Film Art was evolving rapidly

But times were changing, and artists were looking for new ways to express ideas and to engage people. YBT - Young British Artist - with Damien Hirst in the forefront *"invented"* new interactive art - Conceptual Art / Installation Art
(The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living)

### The 21st Century Holy Grail Quest: The Perfect Programming Language :laughing: :earth_africa: :rabbit:

## Episode *NULL*: A Bit of History

A long time ago when dinosaurs still roamed the Pangaea continent, when Windows 3 and computer mouses were cosidered a gimmicky disgrace by true computer engineers, there was the Holy Grail of the perfect programming language - C/C++ :angel:

With C/C++ one could create everything from boring science projects to junk commercial stuff to exciting console-text games. And it ran perfectly on everything because all computers were only desktop PCs with few kilobaits of RAM, no GPUs at all, and only system beeps for exciting multimedia sounds :trumpet:

After aeons of evolution, things changed a little... When Steve Jobs introduced the first iPhone, everyone stopped swinging in trees and started using smart tools. Nowdays every granny uses the mobile computational and networking superpowers to harass their grandchildren on social networks. For good or for bad, computers ceased being a secret exclusive domain of weird and scary computer-science wizards :tophat::sparkles:

As of now we use a zillion of various computer types: smartphones, folding phones, tablets, fablets, keyboard tablets, portable & stationary & hybrid gaming consoles, desktops, laptops, smart watches, AI-powered speaking things, etc. etc. etc. Each is produced by dozens of competing manufacturers, and nearly every device comes with its own unique hardware architecture (GPU, CPU, etc.). Let's not forget the upcoming self-driving cars, internet-of-things, personal chips, and whatsnot. In other words - every little and big thing will be computer & network powered. Mm, and you still have to consider older, not-upgraded devices when developing something :cold_sweat: 

So is there a *swiss-knife* programming language that would cover majority all this new tech landscape? Just like it was in the old good days of MS Dos / MS Windows 3? New kids on the block? Old veterans? Or something entirely new? UFO, perhaps? :alien:

## Episode 1: The 21st Century Tower of Babel

Just like with the Tower of Babel, the symbol of united human race and power, which building was stopped and humanity scattered across the earth to develop different languages, so the situation today with programming languages is not much different. Except that different languages and views give humanity more power then it takes aways, especially when internet connected all those scattered little human beings into one supergiant networking mind :globe_with_meridians:

Today there is a zillion of new and old programming languages to choose from but here is a wishlist for the *perfect* one:
* Universal (from *Big Data* to mutimedia-rich applications) 
* One-code-deploys-everywhere
* Modern syntax
* Mature and stable
* Comprehensive library
* Object-oriented / Data-oriented
* Fast-enough

So is there a contenter for King's Crown yet? The answer is quantum - yes and no. But let's continue with the overview of language plethora though it's the wrong end to start with

## Episode 2: The Language Supermarket

Here is my brief personal (and not entirely correct) overview of some of the most popular languages (in random order)

* **C/C++**. It's still one of the most widely used languages, the grandad and the main influencer of all successors. But it's used as the back end of the enterprise-level applications. You can still build some beautiful little apps with it but not without sinking your teeth first into some behemoth libraries or frameworks first. But it will take a lot of time and effort. And in the end, you won't be able easily to find a job

* **C#**. More modern C/C++ and one of the most popular kids but mostly used for Windows-related stuff and games. Still, it can't go on its own without additional libraries. But if you live in America, probably you would find a job fairly fast with C# on your resume. 

* **Swift**. The direct spiritual descendant of C/C++ with all the modern features, that's the *perfect* one! Except that it isn't, it's just for Apple eco-system. Still, if you live in America, you might get yourself in a sweet spot

* **Rust**. The Modern answer to the Holy Grail of C/C++. Very fast, safe, modern. The most beloved programmers' language of past several years. Even endorsed by some AAA game companies for its Data-Oriented approach and other superpowers. Backed by Mozilla and super-enthusiastic community. Zillions of libraries and tools on Github. Just one little drawback - it's quite immature as of now, in 2020, that it's usable for *Big data* software mostly. Yeah, you can build some stuff for some systems but I will give you an example. The most popular graphics library is GFX developed by a very talented team. It isn't entirely finished yet but thy now switched to the next project - WGPU. Which isn't quite there yet too. Then lots of other libraries, frameworks, tools are built using these not-quite-there-yet libs. And so on and so forth. I think it will take a decade for Rust to comprehensively mature, just like it took decades for C/C++.

* **PHP + SQL.**
* Java
* Kotlin
* **Javascript.** It's browser-dependant and that's a big NO for me as we already burned our fingers during the Netscape VS Internet Explorer War. Even in those days different codes had to be written for those two different browsers. But it was a full-out war and they were changing the browser JS engines like no one's business - to the point that one morning we woke up to find that our software is not running on neither browser at all. Things did change since then. Now the *good* browsers try work more or less in sync with each other, for their own interests. But Microsoft still keeps apart. As of today there are many superb libs and you can do lots of amazing things but still mainting the code is costly. Nevertheless, if you are in a web industry, you *must know* at least the basics of it.
* Go.
* Flutter + Dart
* Lua

## Episode 3: New Mindset

we are transitioning to a "web first" and "mobile first" world

*"What's the perfect programming language?"* is a broken quest from the very start. There is a saying: a programming language is as only as good as its compiler, development tools and the community surrounding it.

In the 21st century it's all about **Frameworks**. So the right way to go about it is to find developing environment (IDE) which fits your purpose(s) and mind the best. 

* QT
* Java + JavaFx + Java
* Xcode
* Flutter
* Unity
* Unreal Engine

### Tables

You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens - (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe \|
```
First Header | Second Header | 3rd Header
:--- | :---: | ---:
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2 | Cell 3
Content in the first column | Content in the second column | Cell 6
```
| First Header | Second Header | 3rd Header |
