### The 21st Century Quest: Looking for the perfect programming language? :laughing: :earth_africa: :rabbit:

A long time ago when dinosaurs still roamed the Pangaea continent, and computer mouses were cosidered a worthless disgrace by true computer engineers, there was the Holy Grail of the perfect programming language - C/C++ :angel:

With C/C++ one could create everything from boring science projects to useless commercial stuff to exciting console-text games. And it ran perfectly on everything because all computers were only desktop PCs with no GPUs and only system beeps for sound :trumpet:

After aeons of evolution, things changed a little...

My knowledge and experience in C/C++ (for diploma), Turbo Pascal 5 (for freelance work), HTML + PHP + SQL, and later in Flash ActionScript 2 + SQL became obsolete.

And so starts my quest of Finding the Perfect Programming language, the Holy Grail of the 21st Century :trophy:

-C/C++
-C#
-Swift
-Rust
-PHP + SQL
-Java
-Javascript
-Flutter + Dart
-Lua

### Tables

You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens - (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe \|
```
First Header | Second Header | 3rd Header
:--- | :---: | ---:
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2 | Cell 3
Content in the first column | Content in the second column | Cell 6
```
| First Header | Second Header | 3rd Header |
| :--- | :---: | ---: |
| Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2 | Cell 3 |
| Content in the first column | Content in the second column | Cell 6 |

### Editor

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/slavinci/slavinci.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/slavinci/slavinci.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
