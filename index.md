### The 21st Century Holy Grail Quest: The Perfect Programming Language :laughing: :earth_africa: :rabbit:

## Episode 1: Short History

A long time ago when dinosaurs still roamed the Pangaea continent, and computer mouses were cosidered a worthless disgrace by true computer engineers, there was the Holy Grail of the perfect programming language - C/C++ :angel:

With C/C++ one could create everything from boring science projects to junk commercial stuff to exciting console-text games. And it ran perfectly on everything because all computers were only desktop PCs with few kilobaits of RAM, no GPUs at all, and only system beeps for exciting multimedia sounds :trumpet:

After aeons of evolution, things changed a little... When Steve Jobs introduced the first iPhone, everyone stopped swinging in trees and started using smart tools. Nowdays every granny uses the mobile computational and networking superpowers to harass their grandchildren on social networks. For good or for bad, computers ceased being an exclusive domain of weird and scary computer-science wizards :tophat::sparkles:

As of now we use a zillion of various computer types: smartphones, fablets, folding phones, tablets, keyboard tablets, portable & stationary & hybrid gaming consoles, desktops, laptops, smart watches, AI-powered things, etc. etc. etc. Each is produced by dozens of competing manufacturers, and nearly every device comes with its own unique hardware architecture (GPU, CPU, etc.). Let's not forget the upcoming self-driving cars, internet-of-things, personal chips, and whatsnot. In other words - absolutely everything will be computer & network powered. Mm, and you still have to consider older, not-upgraded devices when developing something :cold_sweat: 

So where it leaves the old good C/C++? Unfortunatelly, in the dark remote place where no one can see it, with niche exceptions like clever frameworks (Unreal Engine for one). But try using it to write your little app that runs at least on several systems and you will wish you never left that tree in the first place :palm_tree:

## Episode 2: Limbo of the Modern Programming Languages

To cut the long story short, we are still not there yet - there is no *perfect* programming language for all-case scenario (unlike the C/C++ in the Dinosaur Era). 

* C/C++
* C#
* Swift
* Rust
* PHP + SQL
* Java
* Kotlin
* Javascript
* Go
* Flutter + Dart
* Lua

### Tables

You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens - (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe \|
```
First Header | Second Header | 3rd Header
:--- | :---: | ---:
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2 | Cell 3
Content in the first column | Content in the second column | Cell 6
```
| First Header | Second Header | 3rd Header |
| :--- | :---: | ---: |
| Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2 | Cell 3 |
| Content in the first column | Content in the second column | Cell 6 |

### Editor

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/slavinci/slavinci.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/slavinci/slavinci.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### Support or Contact

Having trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.
